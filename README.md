## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - State management website

### What I learned

Something important I learned during the building of the project is Zustand. Whilst I'm not entirely confident yet with the correct usage of the library, I've learned a lot during the building of this project.

### Continued development

I want to work on cleaner state management in my future projects. I'd also like to add smarter CPU moves eventually.
